title=Eggon's Multi-Hit Long Weapons
description=Have you ever wondered why some long weapons can hit only one zombie at a time, while some short ones can hit multiple? Wonder no more, just install this mod and you're golden. Make your Crowbars, Katanas and Golf Clubs multihit weapons.

description=In order for the multihit feature to get applied you have to have the "multihit" option turned on in your Sandbox settings in the first place. Obviously.

description=Mod will not change already spawned items. In order to update your existing weapons right click on them and choose "Refresh [weapon name]". When you are done with updating and want to get rid of the options appearing in the context menu delete the "EMHLW_refreshMultihit.txt" file from the mod folder. Unfortunatelly it will reappear when there's update to the mod, so you will have to remove it again. Hopefully there will not be many updates.
